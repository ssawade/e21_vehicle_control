9.1.
- observer ported into fcn call block
- observer switches physical model depending on clutch status
- observer only resets if velocity is less or equal to negative measured velocity (no longer resets while clutch pedal is pressed)
- new parameter iG_car_temp to totally disconnect drive train in "vehicle_dynamics"
- removed vst_factor
- controller ported into fcn call block
- unnecessary functions in model commented out
- aligned sample time of profile generator with observer and controller
- observer calculates dynamical longitudinal limits in preparation to prevent limitation of command signal trough dynamic adaption of profile generator

To Do
- Replace matlab functions with C functions
- vary velocity profile parameters dependent on the current gear
- Document sample times
- Review sample times
- Optimise rate transitions
- Refactor parameter filt
- Add Simulink parameters to parameter file
- Concept fail-safe functions (e.g. analysis of both throttle sensors)
    - Activation signal H-bridge (toggle PC6 via software -> currently hard coded)
- Add Simulink notes to this file
- debounce clutch and brake pedal
- Include optimizations for calculation of current gear (e.g. plausibility check, debouncing)
- Document logging signals
- Limit maximum adjustable velocity
- Round to decadic reference velocities and implement parameterisable offset
- Evaluate adaption to current longitudinal acceleration of velocity profile generator --> added (6.1.24) --> Fix static offset after setting current velocity as targeted velocity coming from manual mode
- Evaluate Kalman filter
- Add gyroscope/accelerometer
- Implement limiter functionality
- Implement idle controller
- Add lower velocity limiter depending on current gear like upper limiter
- Optimise engine speed limiter if more than one gear change is necessary to reach reference velocity
- Implement low pass in observer for engine/throttle valve delay -> or synchronize function call of profile_gen, observer and controller!
