21.01.24
- added rev_limiter_low
- added condition to only activate vel_ctrl when engine speed is above n_Mot_min_1pmin threshold
- resume function can only be triggered if v_ref != 0.0
- added transition to exit vel_ctrl if engine speed is below n_Mot_min_1pmin (incl. tolerance)
- added new value "override=2" in state machine to determine idle state and trigger idle controller contained in signal selector
    - values override: 0=manual, 1=idle, 2=vel_ctrl
    - adapted traj_gen to new values
- removed gear "-1" in observer and controller


20.01.24
- included reset condition inside observer
- moved ECU_RCP functions to function-called subsystems

19.01.24
- fixed driver override detection
- sending v_ref instead of v_soll to HMI
- removed v_soll_kmph = v_ist_kmph in "manual_operation" state
- optimised rev_limiter: now handles gear changes
- added state_machine_params struct in parameter script

18.01.24
- controller: added calculation of stationary control input to fix driver override detection in state machine and removed old "phi3_velctrl_norm" signal
- state machine: removed internal gear calculation and using external signal
- added gear_calc_params struct in parameter script

09.01.24
- observer ported into fcn call block
- observer switches physical model depending on clutch status
- observer only resets if velocity is less or equal to negative measured velocity (no longer resets while clutch pedal is pressed)
- new parameter iG_car_temp to totally disconnect drive train in "vehicle_dynamics"
- removed vst_factor
- controller ported into fcn call block
- unnecessary functions in model commented out
- aligned sample time of profile generator with observer and controller
- observer calculates dynamical longitudinal limits in preparation to prevent limitation of command signal trough dynamic adaption of profile generator

Tasks
- Replace matlab functions with C functions
- vary velocity profile parameters dependent on the current gear
- Document sample times
- Review sample times
- Optimise rate transitions
- Refactor parameter filt
- Add Simulink parameters to parameter file
- Concept fail-safe functions (e.g. analysis of both throttle sensors)
    - Activation signal H-bridge (toggle PC6 via software -> currently hard coded)
- Add Simulink notes to this file
- debounce clutch and brake pedal
- Include optimizations for calculation of current gear (e.g. plausibility check, debouncing)
- Document logging signals
- (done 19.1.; also limited lower v_ref) Limit maximum adjustable velocity
- (done 21.1.) Round to decadic reference velocities !(and implement parameterisable offset)
- Evaluate adaption to current longitudinal acceleration of velocity profile generator --> added (6.1.24) --> Fix static offset after setting current velocity as targeted velocity coming from manual mode
- Evaluate Kalman filter
- Add gyroscope/accelerometer
- Implement limiter functionality incl. HMI
- (done 21.1.) Implement idle controller
- (done 21.1.) Add lower velocity limiter depending on current gear like upper limiter
- (done 19.1.) Optimise engine speed limiter if more than one gear change is necessary to reach reference velocity
- Implement low pass in observer for engine/throttle valve delay -> or synchronize function call of profile_gen, observer and controller!
- replace approximated vehicle parameters by real measured ones
- (done 19.1.) change of targeted velocity while in driver override state isn't possible
- Implement throttle valve calibration at system startup
- initialise state machine variables in reset state
- resuming into velocity_control_active while clutch pedal is pressed or driver overrides results in override=true for one timestep
- make mounting of throttle pedal sensor more robust and easier to install
